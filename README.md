# Smart Ways to Save
Smart Ways to Save is an education app for iOS and Android built using Dart and the Flutter framework. It teaches users smart ways to save the environment by changing routines in their daily life such as simple tasks like turning off the lights. The game takes inspiration from Dumb Ways to Die, with both games having the purpose of educating the public in mind, and users are required to make the right choice to progress in the game. 

This project was used in a Hackathon, created by Cindy Li and myself.
